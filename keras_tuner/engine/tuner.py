    """Tuner class for Keras models.

    This is the base `Tuner` class for all tuners for Keras models. It manages
    the building, training, evaluation and saving of the Keras models. New
    tuners can be created by subclassing the class.

    All Keras related logics are in `Tuner.run_trial()` and its subroutines.
    When subclassing `Tuner`, if not calling `super().run_trial()`, it can tune
    anything.

    Args:
        oracle: Instance of `Oracle` class.
        hypermodel: Instance of `HyperModel` class (or callable that takes
            hyperparameters and returns a `Model` instance). It is optional
            when `Tuner.run_trial()` is overriden and does not use
            `self.hypermodel`.
        max_model_size: Integer, maximum number of scalars in the parameters of
            a model. Models larger than this are rejected.
        optimizer: Optional optimizer. It is used to override the `optimizer`
            argument in the `compile` step for the models. If the hypermodel
            does not compile the models it generates, then this argument must be
            specified.
        loss: Optional loss. May be used to override the `loss` argument in the
            `compile` step for the models. If the hypermodel does not compile
            the models it generates, then this argument must be specified.
        metrics: Optional metrics. May be used to override the `metrics`
            argument in the `compile` step for the models. If the hypermodel
            does not compile the models it generates, then this argument must
            be specified.
        distribution_strategy: Optional instance of `tf.distribute.Strategy`.
            If specified, each trial will run under this scope. For example,
            `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(['/gpu:0', '/gpu:1'])` will run
            each trial on two GPUs. Currently only single-worker strategies are
            supported.
        directory: A string, the relative path to the working directory.
        project_name: A string, the name to use as prefix for files saved by
            this `Tuner`.
        tuner_id: Optional string, used as the ID of this `Tuner`.
        overwrite: Boolean, defaults to `False`. If `False`, reloads an
            existing project of the same name if one is found. Otherwise,
            overwrites the project.
        executions_per_trial: Integer, the number of executions (training a
            model from scratch, starting from a new initialization) to run per
            trial (model configuration). Model metrics may vary greatly
            depending on random initialization, hence it is often a good idea
            to run several executions per trial in order to evaluate the
            performance of a given set of hyperparameter values.
        **kwargs: Arguments for `BaseTuner`.

    Attributes:
        remaining_trials: Number of trials remaining, `None` if `max_trials` is
            not set. This is useful when resuming a previously stopped search.
