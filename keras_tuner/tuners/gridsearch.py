    Args:
        objective: A string, `keras_tuner.Objective` instance, or a list of
            `keras_tuner.Objective`s and strings. If a string, the direction of
            the optimization (min or max) will be inferred. If a list of
            `keras_tuner.Objective`, we will minimize the sum of all the
            objectives to minimize subtracting the sum of all the objectives to
            maximize. The `objective` argument is optional when
            `Tuner.run_trial()` or `HyperModel.fit()` returns a single float as
            the objective to minimize.
        max_trials: Optional integer, the total number of trials (model
            configurations) to test at most. Note that the oracle may interrupt
            the search before `max_trial` models have been tested if the search
            space has been exhausted. If left unspecified, it runs till the
            search space is exhausted.
        seed: Optional integer, the random seed.
        hyperparameters: Optional `HyperParameters` instance. Can be used to
            override (or register in advance) hyperparameters in the search
            space.
        tune_new_entries: Boolean, whether hyperparameter entries that are
            requested by the hypermodel but that were not specified in
            `hyperparameters` should be added to the search space, or not. If
            not, then the default value for these parameters will be used.

        allow_new_entries: Boolean, whether the hypermodel is allowed to
            request hyperparameter entries not listed in `hyperparameters`.
            Defaults to True.
        max_retries_per_trial: Integer. Defaults to 0. The maximum number of
            times to retry a `Trial` if the trial crashed or the results are invalid.
        max_consecutive_failed_trials: Integer. Defaults to 3. The maximum number of
            consecutive failed `Trial`s. When this number is reached, the search
            will be stopped. A `Trial` is marked as failed when none of the
            retries succeeded.

    This tuner iterates over all possible

    For example, with:

    ```py
    optimizer = hp.Choice("model_name", values=["sgd", "adam"])
    learning_rate = hp.Choice("learning_rate", values=[0.01, 0.1])
    ```

    This tuner will cover the following combinations:
    `["sgd", 0.01], ["sgd", 0.1], ["adam", 0.01] ["adam", 0.1]`.

    For the following hyperparameter types, GridSearch will not exhaust all
    possible values:

    * `hp.Float()` when `step` is left unspecified.
    * `hp.Int()` with `sampling` set to `"log"` or `"reverse_log"`, and `step`
        is left unspecified.

    For these cases, KerasTuner will pick 10 samples in the range evenly by default.
    To configure the granularity of sampling for `hp.Float()` and `hp.Int()`,
    please use the `step` argument in their initializers.

    Args:
        hypermodel: Instance of `HyperModel` class (or callable that takes
            hyperparameters and returns a Model instance). It is optional when
